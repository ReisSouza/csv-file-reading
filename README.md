3. In the csv-file-reading/src/routes.ts file, replace the line 31ate to 35, with the structure of your type
4. If your table didn't have a header that you want to remove, remove line 39, if necessary, skip the header, change const listWithoutHeader = list.slice(N, -1), where N will be the number of lines it will skip
5. On line 42 change the destructuring as if type
